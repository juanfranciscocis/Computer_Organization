    "The possible states that define an instruction execution are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fetch: In this state, the processor retrieves the instruction from the main memory by sending the address of the next instruction to the memory controller. The memory controller then sends the instruction back to the processor, which stores it in the instruction register. Once the instruction is in the instruction register, the program counter is updated to point to the next instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decode: In this state, the processor decodes the instruction by examining the opcode (operation code) and other bits that specify the operands and addressing mode. The processor may also check the validity of the instruction and detect any errors or exceptions that might occur during the execution of the instruction.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Evaluate Address: In this state, the processor calculates the memory address of the operands, based on the addressing mode specified in the instruction. For example, if the instruction specifies a direct address mode, the processor uses the operand field to determine the memory location where the data is stored. If the instruction uses an indirect addressing mode, the processor uses the contents of a register to determine the memory location where the data is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fetch Operands: In this state, the processor retrieves the operands from memory or registers, depending on the addressing mode used in the instruction. The operands are then stored in internal registers or buffers to be used later in the Execute state.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Execute: In this state, the processor performs the operation specified by the opcode, using the operands that were fetched in the previous state. The execution of the operation may involve arithmetic or logical operations, data transfers between registers or memory, or control transfers to other parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Store Result: In this state, the processor stores the result of the operation in the appropriate memory location or register. The processor may also update the program counter to point to the next instruction to be executed."
